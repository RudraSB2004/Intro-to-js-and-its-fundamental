Question 1: Explain What JavaScript Is and Its Role in Web Development.
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is primarily used to add interactivity, 
dynamic content, and complex functionalities to websites. It runs on the client side (in the user's browser)
 and allows for responsive user interactions, such as form validation, animations, and real-time content updates. 
 JavaScript plays a critical role in web development as it enables developers to create engaging, interactive, and
  highly functional web applications by integrating seamlessly with HTML and CSS.

Question 2: Explain the Key Differences Between JavaScript and HTML. Provide Examples of Situations Where You Would Use Each.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to define the structure and content of web pages. It provides tags and elements to specify headers, paragraphs, images, links, and more, giving web pages their basic layout and structure.

JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language that adds interactivity, behavior, and dynamic content to web pages. While HTML structures the content, JavaScript allows for actions like animations, form validation, and user-triggered events.

Examples:

HTML is used to define static elements, such as <h1>, <p>, and <img>. For instance:
<h1>Welcome to Our Site!</h1>
<p>This is the homepage content.</p>
JavaScript is used to handle interactive tasks, like displaying a message when a user clicks a button:
document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
};

Question 3: List and Describe the Five Primitive Data Types in JavaScript.
JavaScript has five primary primitive data types:

String: Represents text data, defined within single or double quotes.
let greeting = "Hello, world!";

Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
let age = 30;
let price = 19.99;

Boolean: Represents a true or false value, used often in conditions.
let isOnline = true;

Undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has an "empty" or "unknown" value.
let data = null;

Question 4: What Is the Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript, and How Do You Declare Them Using the let Keyword?
Declaring variables in JavaScript allows you to store, manipulate, and reference values throughout your program. Variables act as containers for data that can change or be reused, making code more dynamic and manageable.

To declare a variable using the let keyword, you write:
let name = "John Doe";
Using let is recommended over var because it allows you to declare block-scoped variables, reducing the likelihood of bugs due to accidental global scope.

Question 5: Explain the Importance of Comments in JavaScript and Provide Examples of Single-Line and Multi-Line Comments.
Comments are crucial for making code more understandable for other developers (and yourself). They allow you to describe the purpose of complex code sections, explain logic, and make notes about future improvements. Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter, so they don’t affect the code's execution.

Examples:

Single-line comment: Begins with //

// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // This comment is inline with code

Multi-line comment: Begins with /* and ends with */
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines.
*/
let y = 10;

Question 6: Explain the Importance of Choosing Meaningful and Descriptive Variable Names in JavaScript. Provide an Example Where Using a Clear Identifier Improves Code Readability.
Using meaningful and descriptive variable names makes code more readable and easier to understand. Clear identifiers reflect the purpose or role of a variable, so others reading the 
code can quickly grasp its intent without needing additional context. For example:
// Poor naming
let a = 50;
let b = 0.1;
let c = a * b;

// Improved naming
let productPrice = 50;
let discountRate = 0.1;
let discountAmount = productPrice * discountRate;

In the improved code, it’s immediately clear that productPrice represents a price, discountRate is the discount percentage, and discountAmount is the calculated discount, enhancing code readability.
